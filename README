# Regression Machine Learning Case Study Project

How do you work through a predictive modeling machine learning problem end-to-end? In this
lesson you will work through a case study regression predictive modeling problem in Python
including each step of the applied machine learning process. After completing this project, you
will know:

- How to work through a regression predictive modeling problem end-to-end.
- How to use data transforms to improve model performance.
- How to use algorithm tuning to improve model performance.
- How to use ensemble methods and tuning of ensemble methods to improve model perfor-mance.

## 1. Problem Defnition

For this project we will investigate the Boston House Price dataset. Each record in the database
describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. The attributes are dened as follows (taken from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository1):
1. CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
2. ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS: weighted distances to have Boston employment centers
9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per 10,000
11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. B: 1000(Bk ô€€€ 0:63)2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population
14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000s

We can see that the input attributes have a mixture of units.
